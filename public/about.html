<h1>About Me</h1>

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>I am Simone, an aspiring programmer from Philadelphia, PA! I am a musician, avid hiker and rockclimber, and I have two cats and a puppy. I seek a great change in my life that will make it easier to enjoy everything else I want to enjoy in life.</p>

<p>I am hoping by taking this course (which is going very well, by the way) that little by little I will build the necessary skillset to impress an employer and find a position in the tech field where I can utilize my creativity to it's fullest potential!</p>
