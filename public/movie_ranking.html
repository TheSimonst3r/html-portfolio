<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Speaks to my interest in astrophysics, a wondrous marvel of visual effects.</p>
<h3>The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent</h3>
<p>Nicholas Cage's best performance in my opinion, extremely meta and hilarious.</p>
<h3>The Grand Budapest Hotel</h3>
<p>One of my favorite Wes Anderson flicks; the dry humour pulled me into the captivating and convoluted plot immediately.</p>
